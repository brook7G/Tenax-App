# Prescription Scanning App Workspace

This project is a cross-platform mobile application for scanning prescriptions, identifying medicines, and finding local pharmacies in Ethiopia. It uses Flutter for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, with Tesseract OCR, spaCy NLP, PostgreSQL, and Firebase Auth integration.

## Structure
- `frontend/` — Flutter mobile app
- `backend/` — FastAPI backend (Python)

## Setup Steps
1. Create the `frontend` (Flutter) and `backend` (FastAPI) folders.
2. Scaffold a new Flutter app in `frontend/`.
3. Scaffold a FastAPI app in `backend/`.
4. Set up PostgreSQL and connect it to FastAPI.
5. Integrate Tesseract OCR and spaCy in the backend.
6. Set up Firebase Auth for authentication.
7. Integrate Google Maps API for pharmacy lookup.

## Getting Started
- See each folder's README for specific setup instructions.
- Ensure Python, Flutter, and PostgreSQL are installed on your system.
